x = 5 # x is of type int
y = "bob" # y is of type string

print(x) # printing x i.e 5
print(y) # printing y i.e bob


# we can also Specify the Data type of Variables as well 
# This is Called as Casting
z = str(3) # z will be '3' of type string
v = int(4) # v will be '4' of type int
f = float(5) # f will be '5' of type float

# We can also get the Type of Variable to print 

print(type(z))
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
